[Recommended Configuration Changes]  

*Many of these hints are from [tmux: Productive Mouse-Free Development](http://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux) by Brian P. Hogan.*

[^1]: By default `prefix` is mapped to `ctrl-b`. If you haven't remapped your `Caps Lock` key to `ctrl` yet, now would be a good time to do so!

[^2]: This is the line you add to your `.tmux.conf` file

[^3]: You should probably also add a line to unbind the defaults if you bind new keys for things. Just add a line saying `unbind C-b` to unbind the default `prefix` key.
